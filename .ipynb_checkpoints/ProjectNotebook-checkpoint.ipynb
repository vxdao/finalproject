    "I am making a Black Jack game where I can apply random method which we was taught in the class . Mainly there are a dealer and player each will receive 2 cards in the first 2 deal round. The first card of dealer will be hidden , but the player's cards will be show all,then the player need to make a decision first which are either stand , hit or withdraw . Then after that the dealer will open its hidden card to check if they their 2 cards value is 17 or not ,If not the dealer has to hit ( get another card ) until the dealer get at least 17 then dealer will stand and compare its total cards value with the player's card value. Whoever has higher value within 21 is the winner , whoever goes over 21 is busted , an Ace can be count as 11 or 1 to fix in the range less than or equal 21 .
